# Create a plan for a new feature or bug fix

## Introduction

**Note: The current year is 2026.** Use this when dating plans and searching for recent documentation.

Transform feature descriptions, bug reports, or improvement ideas into well-structured markdown files issues that follow project conventions and best practices. This command provides flexible detail levels to match your needs.

## Feature Description

<feature_description> #$ARGUMENTS </feature_description>

### Input Detection

<thinking>
First, detect what kind of input we received:
1. A design document path (ends with `-design.md`) - Skip research, use design context
2. A feature description - Check if design doc exists, run quick brainstorm if not
</thinking>

**Step 1: Check if input is a design document path**

```
If $ARGUMENTS ends with "-design.md" AND file exists:
  → DESIGN MODE: Read design document, skip to Section 2 (Issue Planning)
  → Extract: selected approach, requirements, constraints, research context
  → The design doc already contains explored approaches and validated decisions
```

**Step 2: If not a design document, check if one exists**

```
If $ARGUMENTS is a feature description:
  → Convert to kebab-case: "User Auth Flow" → "user-auth-flow"
  → Check if plans/<kebab-case>-design.md exists

  If design doc EXISTS:
    → Read it and use DESIGN MODE (skip research)

  If design doc DOES NOT exist:
    → Run QUICK BRAINSTORM before proceeding (see below)
```

### Quick Brainstorm (When No Design Doc Exists)

**IMPORTANT:** If no design document exists for this feature, run a quick brainstorm before detailed planning. This ensures we explore approaches before committing to implementation details.

**Quick Brainstorm Process:**

1. **Understand the core idea** (1-2 questions max)
   - Use AskUserQuestion with multiple choice when possible
   - Focus on: What problem? Who benefits? Key constraint?

2. **Present 2-3 approaches** (ALWAYS do this)
   ```
   Approach A: [Name] (Recommended)
   [2-3 sentences] | Effort: S/M/L

   Approach B: [Name]
   [2-3 sentences] | Effort: S/M/L
   ```

   Ask user to select approach using AskUserQuestion.

3. **Confirm scope** (1 question)
   - "Does this capture what you want to build? Anything to add or remove?"

4. **Save quick design** (optional)
   - If approaches were explored, save to `plans/<topic>-design.md`
   - This allows review_plan to access the alternatives later

**Then proceed to Research (Section 1)** with the selected approach in mind.

---

**If the feature description above is empty, ask the user:** "What would you like to plan? Please describe the feature, bug fix, or improvement you have in mind."

Do not proceed until you have a clear feature description from the user.

## Main Tasks

### 1. Repository Research & Context Gathering

<thinking>
First, I need to understand the project's conventions and existing patterns, leveraging all available resources and use parallel subagents to do this. The research findings will be materialized into a context file that subsequent stages (review_plan, workflows:work) can reference.
</thinking>

Run these three agents in parallel at the same time:

- Task repo-research-analyst(feature_description)
- Task best-practices-researcher(feature_description)
- Task framework-docs-researcher(feature_description)

**Reference Collection:**

- [ ] Document all research findings with specific file paths (e.g., `src/services/userService.ts:42`)
- [ ] Include URLs to external documentation and best practices guides
- [ ] Create a reference list of similar issues or PRs (e.g., `#123`, `#456`)
- [ ] Note any team conventions discovered in `CLAUDE.md` or team documentation

### 1.5. Materialize Research Context Artifact

**IMPORTANT:** After research completes, create a companion context file that subsequent stages can reference. This prevents duplicate research in `/workflows:review_plan` and `/workflows:work`.

**Context File Path:** `plans/<plan-name>.context.md` (same base name as the plan)

**Context File Structure:**

```markdown
---
plan: <plan-filename>.md
created: <date>
feature: "<feature description>"
researchers:
  - repo-research-analyst
  - best-practices-researcher
  - framework-docs-researcher
---

# Research Context: <Feature Name>

## Repository Analysis

### Architecture & Conventions
- **Project type**: [e.g., Rails 7 monolith, Next.js app, Python FastAPI]
- **Relevant patterns found**: [file_path:line_number with brief description]
- **Key files for this feature**: [list of files to reference]

### File References (for subsequent agents to load)
```
<list of specific file paths relevant to this feature>
<one per line, with optional :line_number for key sections>
```

### Naming Conventions
- [Convention type]: [pattern observed]
- [Example files that demonstrate the convention]

### Team Conventions (from CLAUDE.md)
- [Key conventions relevant to this feature]
- [Specific rules or patterns to follow]

## External Research

### Framework Documentation
- [Framework/library]: [URL]
- [Relevant guide]: [URL]

### Best Practices Found
- [Best practice 1 with source]
- [Best practice 2 with source]

### Similar Implementations
- [Internal similar code]: [file_path:line_number]
- [External reference]: [URL or description]

## Gotchas & Warnings
- ⚠️ [Warning about existing code or patterns to be aware of]
- ⚠️ [Potential pitfall discovered during research]

## Gaps & Unknowns
- [Areas where research didn't find clear answers]
- [Questions for user or areas needing deeper investigation]

## Research Quality
- **Confidence**: [High/Medium/Low]
- **Last verified**: <date>

```

**Why This Matters:**
- `/workflows:review_plan` agents can load this context first, building on prior research
- `/workflows:work` can immediately load relevant files
- Research is traceable and shareable with team members

**Note:** Approach selection is now handled by the Quick Brainstorm in the Input Detection section, or by a full `/workflows:brainstorm` session beforehand. This ensures approaches are always explored before detailed planning.

### 2. Issue Planning & Structure

<thinking>
Think like a product manager - what would make this issue clear and actionable? Consider multiple perspectives
</thinking>

**Title & Categorization:**

- [ ] Draft clear, searchable issue title using conventional format (e.g., `feat: Add user authentication`, `fix: Cart total calculation`)
- [ ] Determine issue type: enhancement, bug, refactor
- [ ] Convert title to kebab-case filename: strip prefix colon, lowercase, hyphens for spaces
  - Example: `feat: Add User Authentication` → `feat-add-user-authentication.md`
  - Keep it descriptive (3-5 words after prefix) so plans are findable by context

**Stakeholder Analysis:**

- [ ] Identify who will be affected by this issue (end users, developers, operations)
- [ ] Consider implementation complexity and required expertise

**Content Planning:**

- [ ] Choose appropriate detail level based on issue complexity and audience
- [ ] List all necessary sections for the chosen template
- [ ] Gather supporting materials (error logs, screenshots, design mockups)
- [ ] Prepare code examples or reproduction steps if applicable, name the mock filenames in the lists

### 3. SpecFlow Analysis

After planning the issue structure, run SpecFlow Analyzer to validate and refine the feature specification:

- Task spec-flow-analyzer(feature_description, research_findings)

**SpecFlow Analyzer Output:**

- [ ] Review SpecFlow analysis results
- [ ] Incorporate any identified gaps or edge cases into the issue
- [ ] Update acceptance criteria based on SpecFlow findings

### 4. Choose Implementation Detail Level

### 5. Issue Creation & Formatting

<thinking>
Apply best practices for clarity and actionability, making the issue easy to scan and understand
</thinking>

**Content Formatting:**

- [ ] Use clear, descriptive headings with proper hierarchy (##, ###)
- [ ] Include code examples in triple backticks with language syntax highlighting
- [ ] Add screenshots/mockups if UI-related (drag & drop or use image hosting)
- [ ] Use task lists (- [ ]) for trackable items that can be checked off
- [ ] Add collapsible sections for lengthy logs or optional details using `<details>` tags
- [ ] Apply appropriate emoji for visual scanning (🐛 bug, ✨ feature, 📚 docs, ♻️ refactor)

**Cross-Referencing:**

- [ ] Link to related issues/PRs using #number format
- [ ] Reference specific commits with SHA hashes when relevant
- [ ] Link to code using GitHub's permalink feature (press 'y' for permanent link)
- [ ] Mention relevant team members with @username if needed
- [ ] Add links to external resources with descriptive text

**Code & Examples:**

````markdown
# Good example with syntax highlighting and line references


```typescript
// src/services/userService.ts:42
export async function processUser(user: User): Promise<void> {
  // Implementation here
}
```

# Collapsible error logs

<details>
<summary>Full error stacktrace</summary>

`Error details here...`

</details>
````

**AI-Era Considerations:**

- [ ] Account for accelerated development with AI pair programming
- [ ] Include prompts or instructions that worked well during research
- [ ] Note which AI tools were used for initial exploration (Claude, Copilot, etc.)
- [ ] Emphasize comprehensive testing given rapid implementation
- [ ] Document any AI-generated code that needs human review

### 6. Final Review & Submission

**Pre-submission Checklist:**

- [ ] Title is searchable and descriptive
- [ ] Labels accurately categorize the issue
- [ ] All template sections are complete
- [ ] Links and references are working
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are measurable
- [ ] Add names of files in pseudo code examples and todo lists
- [ ] Add an ERD mermaid diagram if applicable for new model changes

## Output Format

**Filenames:** Use the kebab-case filename from Step 2 Title & Categorization.

```
plans/<type>-<descriptive-name>.md           # The plan
plans/<type>-<descriptive-name>.context.md   # Research context artifact
```

Examples:
- ✅ `plans/feat-user-authentication-flow.md` + `plans/feat-user-authentication-flow.context.md`
- ✅ `plans/fix-checkout-race-condition.md` + `plans/fix-checkout-race-condition.context.md`
- ✅ `plans/refactor-api-client-extraction.md` + `plans/refactor-api-client-extraction.context.md`
- ❌ `plans/plan-1.md` (not descriptive)
- ❌ `plans/new-feature.md` (too vague)
- ❌ `plans/feat: user auth.md` (invalid characters)

**Write both files:** The plan file contains the actionable implementation plan. The context file contains reusable research that subsequent stages (`/workflows:review_plan`, `/workflows:work`) will reference to avoid duplicate research.

**If a design document was used as input:**
- Add `design_doc: plans/<topic>-design.md` to the plan's frontmatter
- Reference the design document in the context file's "File References" section
- This allows `/workflows:review_plan` to access all explored approaches from brainstorming

## Post-Generation Options

After writing the plan file, use the **AskUserQuestion tool** to present these options:

**Question:** "Plan ready at `plans/<issue_title>.md`. What would you like to do next?"

**Options:**
1. **Open plan in editor** - Open the plan file for review
2. **Run `/workflows:review_plan`** - Deepen and review the plan with parallel research and reviewer agents
3. **Start `/workflows:work`** - Begin implementing this plan locally
4. **Start `/workflows:work` on remote** - Begin implementing in Claude Code on the web (use `&` to run in background)
5. **Create Issue** - Create issue in project tracker (GitHub/Linear)
6. **Simplify** - Reduce detail level

Based on selection:
- **Open plan in editor** → Run `open plans/<issue_title>.md` to open the file in the user's default editor
- **`/workflows:review_plan`** → Call the /workflows:review_plan command with the plan file path to deepen and review
- **`/workflows:work`** → Call the /workflows:work command with the plan file path
- **`/workflows:work` on remote** → Run `/workflows:work plans/<issue_title>.md &` to start work in background for Claude Code web
- **Create Issue** → See "Issue Creation" section below
- **Simplify** → Ask "What should I simplify?" then regenerate simpler version
- **Other** (automatically provided) → Accept free text for rework or specific changes

**Note:** If running `/workflows:plan` with ultrathink enabled, automatically run `/workflows:review_plan` after plan creation for maximum depth and grounding.

Loop back to options after Simplify or Other changes until user selects `/workflows:work` or `/workflows:review_plan`.

## Issue Creation

When user selects "Create Issue", detect their project tracker from CLAUDE.md:

1. **Check for tracker preference** in user's CLAUDE.md (global or project):
   - Look for `project_tracker: github` or `project_tracker: linear`
   - Or look for mentions of "GitHub Issues" or "Linear" in their workflow section

2. **If GitHub:**
   ```bash
   # Extract title from plan filename (kebab-case to Title Case)
   # Read plan content for body
   gh issue create --title "feat: [Plan Title]" --body-file plans/<issue_title>.md
   ```

3. **If Linear:**
   ```bash
   # Use linear CLI if available, or provide instructions
   # linear issue create --title "[Plan Title]" --description "$(cat plans/<issue_title>.md)"
   ```

4. **If no tracker configured:**
   Ask user: "Which project tracker do you use? (GitHub/Linear/Other)"
   - Suggest adding `project_tracker: github` or `project_tracker: linear` to their CLAUDE.md

5. **After creation:**
   - Display the issue URL
   - Ask if they want to proceed to `/workflows:work` or `/workflows:review_plan`

NEVER CODE! Just research and write the plan.
