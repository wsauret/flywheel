# Question Resolution Procedure

How to present and resolve open questions one at a time during plan consolidation.

## Scan for Questions

Search the plan for all unresolved items:

**Structured (from verification/review):**
- `### Open Questions` sections/tables
- `OPEN QUESTION:` markers

**Explicit markers:**
- TODO, TBD, "to be decided"
- "Decision needed" or "requires decision"

**Implicit alternatives:**
- "Option A vs Option B" language
- "Either... or..." constructions
- "Alternatively," followed by different approach

**Conflicts (converted to questions):**
- Reviewer disagreements from "Conflicts Between Reviewers" section

---

## Question Presentation Format

Present **one question at a time** using this format:

```
Question: "[Topic]: [The question]"

Context: [Brief explanation of why this matters]

My recommendation: [Preferred option and why]

Options:
1. [Option A] (Recommended) - [Brief description]
2. [Option B] - [Brief description]
3. "You pick what's best" - Let me decide
```

## Handle Responses

- **User picks an option** -- Record the decision with their rationale
- **User picks "You decide"** -- Apply the recommendation, note it was delegated
- **User provides custom answer** -- Record their direction exactly

Record all decisions for inclusion in the consolidated plan's "Decisions Made" section.

## Key Rules

- Always present one question at a time -- never batch multiple questions
- Always provide a recommendation with reasoning
- Always include the "You pick" escape hatch
- Never proceed to synthesis with unresolved questions
