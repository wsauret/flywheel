# Design Iteration Procedure

Detailed 5-step procedure for Phase 5b when user has feedback on the design.

---

## Step 1: Confirm Understanding

```
Based on your feedback, I understand you want to:
- [Change 1 with specific detail]
- [Change 2 with specific detail]

Is this correct?
```

## Step 2: Research If Needed

- If changes require new technical understanding: spawn locator/analyzer
- If changes are scope adjustments: skip research

## Step 3: Present Proposed Changes

```
I plan to update the design by:
- [Modification 1]
- [Modification 2]

Does this align with your intent?
```

## Step 4: Apply Changes Surgically

- Edit specific sections, don't rewrite whole document
- Preserve what's working
- Use Edit tool for precision

## Step 5: Re-validate Modified Sections

- Only validate the parts that changed
- "Here's the updated [section]. Does this look right?"

## Guardrails

**Max 3 iteration cycles.** If still not converged, suggest stepping back to re-examine the core problem (Phase 2).
